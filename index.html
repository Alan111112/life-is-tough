        there is no black or white or brown or arabic or kordish or turkish we all are humans, we need to stop fighting, and learn from each other <br>
        and help each other help the poor the old and the young people that needs more care instead of fighting, there are people that cant eat dont have money, <br>
        and what goverments do is only taking the money and spend it all on guns and tanks and drones and at the end all of them well die, the poor the rich<br>
        and none of that money will help you in that or the lands none of them is yours forever,in this lonely world if we dont love each other <br>
